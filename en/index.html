December 2023</h6><h1>Preparations and December Activities</h1><p>As December unfolds, children gather 'round the tree!<br>This year, Santa brings car parts and joy beneath our tree! Teams have been working hard since September.</p><h2>About the Teams</h2><p><strong>Team Üks Jupp</strong>, with veterans from last year, ventured to the Greenpower competition in Chichester (UK) in October! They secured a humble position, but the essence of competition lies in self-surpassing, and they did just that! Currently, they're enhancing the car to achieve new heights.<br>Meanwhile, <strong>Team Okas</strong> and <strong>Pink Python</strong> pose as contenders. These two teams, comprising newcomers, are swiftly catching up. External motivation is crucial for self-improvement, and competition is our game ;). Team Okas completed electrical work, and the frame is set to go. Now, they're brainstorming a cover in the Rhino classes!<br><strong>Team Beegreen</strong> progresses at its pace. Team McQueen's work concluded due to the graduation of our 12th graders, but 5 new members joined. Beegreen chose a unique challenge to build the car from scratch! No pre-built frame or guide! They aim for speeds beyond our other teams with the Formula 24+ Kit Cars! Currently, they're crafting a 3D model of the frame in Solidworks and selecting materials (likely stainless steel for the frame and carbon fiber or fiberglass for the cover :O).</p><h2>What Else?</h2><p>Tomorrow, December 9th, marks the VHK &quot;Nigulalaat&quot;, where all members step out of their teams to introduce Arduino Uno usage to visitors. Interested individuals can hop into Team One Piece's car for a simulated drive. The fair is in the cellar of Okasroosikese castle —where our dreams materialize!
