# Team pages

Please consider the following guidelines when creating a team page:

- Team page should follow the general structure and design of the website. It is recommended to use an exisiting layout like `/jupp` for team page.
- Team page should include a brief description of the team, hero photo and its members. Photo gallery, longer about me, additional information is optional.
- Assets should be in the corresponding team folder in `/assets/(team name)`.
