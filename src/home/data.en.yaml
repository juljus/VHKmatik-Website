  title: About Us
  text: VHK STEM course is an extracurricular activity for the high school students in the Old Town Educational College of Tallinn which is available to students studying in the engineering field. The program is divided into 4 groups where each team works on one Greenpower car. In a team, each member has their own responsibilities – from working on the car's design and mechanics to marketing and branding.

  title2: What is STEM?
  text2: STEM is an acronym for a study method which combines Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. The objective of the program is to give students the ability to exercise theory learnt in a classroom and apply it in real life situations. A specialty of VHK STEM is that the students are put into a group environment which gives them the means to gain experience on how to coordinate workflow and run an enterprise of their own.
