  # About Us

  We are students from the engineering class at Vanalinna Hariduskolleegium and are building electric cars in the MATIK lesson.

  Divided into four teams, each with their own car, we meet regularly once a week, but a large part of the work also gets done outside of class.
  
  We have already competed twice in the UK and plan to go again next spring!
