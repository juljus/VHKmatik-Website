# England Greenpower Finals Retrospective

The Greenpower finals is the culmination of the Greenpower season. The event is held at the Goodwood Motor Circuit, and is the only event in the season where all the teams from across the country come together.

It was a huge moment for us, as we worked on it non-stop for the entire September. We were excited to take part in such event and see how our car would perform against the other - I say, much more successful - teams.

We managed to finish 32th out of 37th in the F24+ finals and despite the low ranking, we are very satisfied with the results, due to the fact that the car actually managed to finish. There were no preparations done to test how long the car would last. During the beginning of the race, I, the driver, had suspicion that the motor was overheating, but alas it continued on normally. It was probably related to bad wiring.

The race inspired us to come up with new ideas for the next season, so much that a new livery is cooking up in the workshop. We can't wait to showcase it fully soon, but meanwhile, keep an eye on 1Jupp social media for car updates.

Also, we're looking forward to participate in a race soon (Spain or England), please contact us if you are interested in helping us achieve that. Anyways, here are some pictures of the race.
