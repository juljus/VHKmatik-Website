# Introduction Evening for MATIK and VHK Engineering Branch

On November 14th, an introduction evening for STEM and the VHK engineering branch took place at the Okasroosikese Castle. The event was attended by several students, parents, university rectors and professors, as well as representatives from various engineering fields. The high school head of studies, Irja Tuus, spoke about the engineering branch, Javier Ortin Cervera focused on introducing STEM and its beginnings, and students and alumni shared their experiences in competitions. The aim of the introduction evening was to find sponsors for the teams, draw attention to the need for engineering in the world, and highlight the importance of students in the future development of engineering.

During the evening, it was possible to ride in a car simulator made by the students and to take a look around the basement of the Okasroosikese Castle, where we build cars. In the hall, students presented their engineering projects, including Team Ãœksjupp with their car, which competed in England this fall.
