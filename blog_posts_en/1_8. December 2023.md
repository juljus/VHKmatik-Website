# Preparations and December Activities

As December unfolds,
children gather 'round the tree!

This year, Santa brings car parts and joy beneath our tree!
Teams have been working hard since September.

## About the Teams

**Team Üks Jupp**, with veterans from last year, ventured to the Greenpower competition in Chichester (UK) in October! They secured a humble position, but the essence of competition lies in self-surpassing, and they did just that! Currently, they're enhancing the car to achieve new heights.

Meanwhile, **Team Okas** and **Pink Python** pose as contenders. These two teams, comprising newcomers, are swiftly catching up. External motivation is crucial for self-improvement, and competition is our game ;). Team Okas completed electrical work, and the frame is set to go. Now, they're brainstorming a cover in the Rhino classes!

**Team Beegreen** progresses at its pace. Team McQueen's work concluded due to the graduation of our 12th graders, but 5 new members joined. Beegreen chose a unique challenge to build the car from scratch! No pre-built frame or guide! They aim for speeds beyond our other teams with the Formula 24+ Kit Cars! Currently, they're crafting a 3D model of the frame in Solidworks and selecting materials (likely stainless steel for the frame and carbon fiber or fiberglass for the cover :O).

## What Else?

Tomorrow, December 9th, marks the VHK "Nigulalaat", where all members step out of their teams to introduce Arduino Uno usage to visitors. Interested individuals can hop into Team One Piece's car for a simulated drive. The fair is in the cellar of Okasroosikese castle —where our dreams materialize! Interested ;)?
