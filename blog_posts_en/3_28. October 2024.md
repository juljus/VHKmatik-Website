# RC 1Jupp Raced in the Greenpower 2024 Finals for the Second Time

RC 1Jupp - consiting of members Henri Johannes Aunin, alumnus Tristjan Lutter, Georg P채rtel P천ldm채e, and Laur Vesingi - participated in the Greenpower STEM finals in England under the guidance of teacher Javier Ortin Cervera.

After last year's competition, we continued working on the same car. We learned last year that aerodynamics matter, cooling is important, and the gear ratio must be correct for an hour of driving. We started building a new body by trial and error: we made a mold from polystyrene pieces and macroflex, on which we put a glass fiber cloth and a layer of carbon fiber on top - big thanks to Laur Vesing's relatives! We also ordered new gears for a 1:4 ratio. We also installed a computer fan on the engine, which was a risk, as the fan also consumes the car's batteries. That led to the car batteries running out during the competition.

After dozens of hours of work, the car was ready the day before being transported to England. On Wednesday morning, we loaded the electric formula onto a van, and Javier, P채rtel, and Tristjan started from Tallinn to reach the ship in Liepaja by evening, which took them to Germany in 24 hours. The autobahn took them to Belgium and then straight to the Calais train station to take the train through the Channel Tunnel to Dover. On the way, they visited an auto museum and got to know different cities and churches (including the magnificent Canterbury Cathedral).

By Saturday afternoon, they reached the town of Chichester, where the Goodwood circuit is located and where the Greenpower electric formula finals took place. We passed the technical inspection the first time, and driver Henri and Laur arrived by plane in the evening. The competition took place the next day, and we arrived early at 8 a.m. The car drove smoothly during the test run, and no problems arose. Before the competition, we installed a new steering wheel, which Javier had modeled and 3D printed beforehand.

At the beginning of the competition, we immediately passed several cars, but we couldn't catch up with the faster formulas. With each lap, our car drove slower due to the batteries running out because it was heavier, and the fan also consumed energy. We also didn't take into account that the Goodwood circuit is hilly and ascending requires more energy from the engine. At the end of the competition, when there was still half a lap to go, the batteries ran out. Fortunately, we got a slightly better place than last time: 38th out of 44.

Despite the fact that the car did not finish, we are satisfied with the appearance of the car (we received many compliments). The experience was worthwhile and we gained numerous new contacts. We also got the opportunity to compete in Belgium. We celebrated at the local Five Guys and then headed home - three by driving and two by plane.
