March 2023</h6><h1>England Greenpower Finals Retrospective</h1><p>The Greenpower finals is the culmination of the Greenpower season. The event is held at the Goodwood Motor Circuit, and is the only event in the season where all the teams from across the country come together.<br>It was a huge moment for us, as we worked on it non-stop for the entire September. We were excited to take part in such event and see how our car would perform against the other - I say, much more successful - teams.<br>We managed to finish 32th out of 37th in the F24+ finals and despite the low ranking, we are very satisfied with the results, due to the fact that the car actually managed to finish. There were no preparations done to test how long the car would last. During the beginning of the race, I, the driver, had suspicion that the motor was overheating, but alas it continued on normally. It was probably related to bad wiring.<br>The race inspired us to come up with new ideas for the next season, so much that a new livery is cooking up in the workshop. We can't wait to showcase it fully soon, but meanwhile, keep an eye on 1Jupp social media for car updates.<br>Also, we're looking forward to participate in a race soon (Spain or England), please contact us if you are interested in helping us achieve that. Anyways, here are some pictures of the race.<br><img src="/assets/P2400651.JPG" alt="Team laughing"> <img src="/assets/P2400692.JPG" alt="Test drive"> <img src="/assets/P2400700.JPG" alt="After test drive"> <img src="/assets/P2400722.JPG" alt="Lunch"> <img src="/assets/P2400727.JPG" alt="Driver readying up for race"> <img src="/assets/P2400730.JPG" alt="Team member looking at horizon"> <img src="/assets/P2400737.JPG" alt="Tense driver"> <img src="/assets/P2400750.JPG" alt="Preparing for Greenpower Finals"> <img src="/assets/P2400763.JPG" alt="Greenpower Finals Weiko Kalew car"> <img src="/assets/P2400762.JPG" alt="Greenpower Finals Weiko Kalew car"></p></div><div class="blog-post container"><h6>8. December 2023</h6><h1>Preparations and December Activities</h1><p>As December unfolds, children gather 'round the tree!<br>This year, Santa brings car parts and joy beneath our tree! Teams have been working hard since September.</p><h2>About the Teams</h2><p><strong>Team Üks Jupp</strong>, with veterans from last year, ventured to the Greenpower competition in Chichester (UK) in October! They secured a humble position, but the essence of competition lies in self-surpassing, and they did just that! Currently, they're enhancing the car to achieve new heights.<br>Meanwhile, <strong>Team Okas</strong> and <strong>Pink Python</strong> pose as contenders. These two teams, comprising newcomers, are swiftly catching up. External motivation is crucial for self-improvement, and competition is our game ;). Team Okas completed electrical work, and the frame is set to go. Now, they're brainstorming a cover in the Rhino classes!<br><strong>Team Beegreen</strong> progresses at its pace. Team McQueen's work concluded due to the graduation of our 12th graders, but 5 new members joined. Beegreen chose a unique challenge to build the car from scratch! No pre-built frame or guide! They aim for speeds beyond our other teams with the Formula 24+ Kit Cars! Currently, they're crafting a 3D model of the frame in Solidworks and selecting materials (likely stainless steel for the frame and carbon fiber or fiberglass for the cover :O).</p><h2>What Else?</h2><p>Tomorrow, December 9th, marks the VHK &quot;Nigulalaat&quot;, where all members step out of their teams to introduce Arduino Uno usage to visitors. Interested individuals can hop into Team One Piece's car for a simulated drive. The fair is in the cellar of Okasroosikese castle —where our dreams materialize! Interested ;)?</p></div></div></main><footer><div class="about footer-item"><h4>VHK Matik 2024</h4><p><a href="https://greenpower.co.uk">Greenpower</a></p><p><a href="https://www.vhk.ee">Vanalinna Hariduskolleegium</a></p><p>Teacher: Javier Ortin Cervera</p></div><div class="sitemap footer-item"><h4>Sitemap</h4><p><a href="/">VHK Matik</a></p><ul>Teams<div><li style="list-style-type:none;margin-left:.5em"><a href="/teams/beegreen">BeeGreen</a></li><li style="list-style-type:none;margin-left:.5em"><a href="/teams/jupp">1Jupp</a></li><li style="list-style-type:none;margin-left:.5em"><a href="/teams/okas">Okas</a></li><li style="list-style-type:none;margin-left:.5em"><a href="/teams/pinkpython">Pink Python</a></li></div></ul><p><a href="/blog">Blog</a></p><p><a href="/sponsor">Sponsor</a></p></div><div class="socials footer-item"><h4>Contact</h4><p><a href="mailto:matik@vhk.ee">matik@vhk.ee</a></p><ul style="list-style-type:none"><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/people/VHK-Matik/61553995101015/">Facebook</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/vhk_matik/">Instagram</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MATIKVHK">Youtube</a></li><li><a href="https://ee.linkedin.com/company/vhk-greenpower">Linkedin</a></li></ul></div></footer><script src="/script.js"></script></body></html>
